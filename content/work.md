# Work

I'm an engineering leader with a strong technical background, who values team collaboration and supporting individual growth. I excel at navigating difficult technological and business trade-offs in medium-sized teams.

Presently I'm looking to build products that address security, identity or collaboration challenges for <abbr title="Small-to-Medium Enterprises">SMEs</addr>. I can provide most value to a small team that's looking to grow, or a medium-sized team that's looking to improve.

Technologies I've worked with most recently, either directly or via my teams, are:

- Node.js & TypeScript
- Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Firestore, IAM, Kubernetes, Pub/Sub)
- Golang
- Mobile app development (predominantly React Native, with some Swift & Kotlin)
- GitOps with ArgoCD & Config Connector to manage deployments and environments

## Involvements

An overview of the major products I've worked on in the past fifteen-odd years. In between I've done some [consulting](#consulting) and [open source](/open-source) work.

### State

_State_ was an attempt to build a social network that connected people through their opinions. Founded by [Alex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Asseily) & Mark Asseily, it lost out against products like Twitter and arguably missed the rise of the iPhone and subsequent industry shifts.

I joined the initial small team in late 2008 and stayed on through 2015, growing to be one of the lead engineers and taking charge of the frontend architecture as well as making significant backend contributions.

Proud achievements (given the technology available at the time) include:

- Early adoption of Node.js
- Development of an internal framework to (server-side) render reactive pages (in 2011!)
- An API gateway powering the website & mobile apps
- An OAuth implementation including social sign-on, across web and mobile
- Push notification delivery

## Consulting {#consulting}

I've done consulting work for [SitePen](https://sitepen.com/) on [Dojo 2](https://dojo.io/) and [Digital Catapult](https://www.digicatapult.org.uk) on blockchain projects.
