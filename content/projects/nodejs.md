# Node.js Modules

I maintain several Node.js modules. Here's a list of the most noteworthy ones, in alphabetical order:

* [`@novemberborn/eslint-plugin-as-i-preach`](https://github.com/novemberborn/as-i-preach) is my preferred [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) setup.
* [`base-convert-int-array`](https://github.com/novemberborn/base-convert-int-array) converts arrays of integers from one base to another. Uses an O(NÂ²) algorithm.
* [`common-path-prefix`](https://github.com/novemberborn/common-path-prefix) computes the longest prefix string that is common to each path, excluding the
base component.
* [Concordance](https://github.com/concordancejs/) compares, formats, diffs and snapshots any JavaScript value. Used by [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava).
* [`identifierfy`](https://github.com/novemberborn/identifierfy) rewrites an identifier string so its valid according to ES2015.
* [`ignore-by-default`](https://github.com/novemberborn/ignore-by-default) provides a list of directories that should probably be ignored by development
tools, e.g. when watching for file changes. Used by
[AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava).
* [`ksuid`](https://github.com/novemberborn/ksuid) is a Node.js implementation of [Segment's KSUID library](https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid).
* [`never`](https://github.com/novemberborn/never) provides a function that throws when called, useful with nullish coalescing to elide unexpected nullish values.
* [`package-hash`](https://github.com/novemberborn/package-hash) generates a hash for an installed npm package, which is useful for salting caches. Used by
[AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava).
* [`release-zalgo`](https://github.com/novemberborn/release-zalgo) helps you write code with promise-like chains that can run both synchronously and asynchronously.
* [`well-known-symbols`](https://github.com/novemberborn/well-known-symbols) checks whether a symbol is [well-known](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol#Well-known_symbols).
* [`x690`](https://github.com/novemberborn/x690) is a low-level decoder for X.690 Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER).
