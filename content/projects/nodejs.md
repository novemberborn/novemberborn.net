# Node.js Modules

I maintain several Node.js modules. Here's a list of the most
noteworthy ones, in alphabetical order:

* [`as-i-preach`](https://github.com/novemberborn/as-i-preach) is my preferred
[ESLint](http://eslint.org/) setup.

* [`base-convert-int-array`](https://github.com/novemberborn/base-convert-int-array) converts arrays of integers from one base to another. Uses an O(NÂ²) algorithm.

* [`common-path-prefix`](https://github.com/novemberborn/common-path-prefix)
computes the longest prefix string that is common to each path, excluding the
base component.

* [Concordance](https://github.com/concordancejs/) compares, formats, diffs and snapshots any JavaScript value. Used by
[AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava).

* [`identifierfy`](https://github.com/novemberborn/identifierfy) rewrites an
identifier string so its valid according to ES2015.

* [`ignore-by-default`](https://github.com/novemberborn/ignore-by-default)
provides a list of directories that should probably be ignored by development
tools, e.g. when watching for file changes. Used by
[AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava).

* [`ksuid`](https://github.com/novemberborn/ksuid) is a Node.js implementation of [Segment's KSUID library](https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid).

* [`package-hash`](https://github.com/novemberborn/package-hash) generates a
hash for an installed npm package, which is useful for salting caches. Used by
[AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava).

* [`release-zalgo`](https://github.com/novemberborn/release-zalgo) helps you write code with promise-like chains that can run both synchronously and asynchronously.

* [`sixtyfour`](https://github.com/novemberborn/sixtyfour) contains Base64
utilities.

* [`source-map-fixtures`](https://github.com/novemberborn/source-map-fixtures)
are simple test fixtures backed by inline source maps and source map files. Can
be used to test code that needs to resolve or apply source maps. Used by
[AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) and
[nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc).

* [`unicode-diff`](https://github.com/novemberborn/unicode-diff) provides the
differences between Unicode versions. Useful when dealing with programs that
don't handle newer code points.

* [`well-known-symbols`](https://github.com/novemberborn/well-known-symbols) checks whether a symbol is [well-known](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol#Well-known_symbols).

* [`x690`](https://github.com/novemberborn/x690) is a low-level decoder for
X.690 Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER).

## Archived

* [`cloudflare-origin-pull`](https://github.com/novemberborn/cloudflare-origin-pull)
helps you verify requests to your Node.js server came from CloudFlare.

* [`common-extname`](https://github.com/novemberborn/common-extname) computes
the longest (compound) extension that is common to each path.
