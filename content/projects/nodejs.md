# Smallish Node.js Modules

I maintain several smallish Node.js modules. Here's a list of the most
noteworthy ones, in alphabetical order:

* [`common-extname`](https://github.com/novemberborn/common-extname) computes
the longest (compound) extension that is common to each path.

* [`common-path-prefix`](https://github.com/novemberborn/common-path-prefix)
computes the longest prefix string that is common to each path, excluding the
base component.

* [`identifierfy`](https://github.com/novemberborn/identifierfy) rewrites an
identifier string so its valid according to ES2015.

* [`sixtyfour`](https://github.com/novemberborn/sixtyfour) contains Base64
utilities.

* [`source-map-fixtures`](https://github.com/novemberborn/source-map-fixtures)
are simple test fixtures backed by inline source maps and source map files. Can
be used to test code that needs to resolve or apply source maps. Used by
[`ava`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava) and
[`nyc`](https://github.com/bcoe/nyc).

* [`unicode-diff`](https://github.com/novemberborn/unicode-diff) provides the
differences between Unicode versions. Useful when dealing with programs that
don't handle newer code points.
