Hi! My name's Mark Wubben. I'm a humanist & technologist who loves working with
the web. In the above picture I'm wearing a fabulous [Irish tweed
cap](http://www.aransweatermarket.com/irish-tweed-flat-caps).

Living in London (the English one) I enjoy the

[scene](http://www.partizanbrewing.co.uk/), as well as Scottish [single
malts](http://www.laphroaig.com/). You might spot me riding an white / orange
[Brompton bike](https://www.brompton.com/). You'll definitely see me at a
[Hawksley Workman](http://hawksleyworkman.com/) or [Buck 65](http://buck65.com/)
gig. Priority podcast listens are [This American
Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/) & [The Talk
Show](http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/).

## Skills & Background

I've been working with the web professionally for over ten years. Initially a
front-end engineer I'm now more interested in building products as a whole. I'm
open to challenging projects. [Learn more about my skills and
background](/skills-and-background).

## Projects

I maintain several [smallish Node.js modules](/projects/nodejs) and [Babel
plugins](/projects/babel-plugins). I'm a collaborator on the
[nyc](https://github.com/bcoe/nyc) code coverage tool. I'm also building
[Buoyant](/projects/buoyant): a framework for building distributed systems using
the [Raft Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/).

Back in the ES5 era I wrote a small ecosystem of [functional promise-based
libraries](/projects/legendary).

## Elsewhere

I post the occasional [tweet](https://twitter.com/novemberborn) or
