Hey! You've found the online home of Mark Wubben. Over on the right is me and my dog, an overly friendly Shih Tzu × Yorkshire Terrier lass.

Having grown up in the Netherlands, I've lived in Copenhagen and London, and now find myself in the original Haarlem with <abbr title="spouse">👩‍💻</abbr>, <abbr title="kid">👶</abbr> and <abbr title="dog">🐶</abbr>.

I enjoy genmaicha & rooibos tea, pour-over coffee & brownies, science-fiction shows, podcasts, the woods, and fairly obscure Canadian musicians.

## Work

I'm an engineering leader with a strong technical background, who values team collaboration and supporting individual growth. I excel at navigating difficult technological and business trade-offs in medium-sized teams.

I'm open to new opportunities. [Learn more about my work](/work) and <a data-email="bcd1ddced7fcd2d3cad9d1ded9ceded3ced292d2d9c8">get in touch</a>.

## Open Source

I've been involved in open source projects for over twenty years. My more recent contributions come as lead maintainer of [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava), a Node.js test runner. [Find out more about my open source projects](/open-source).
