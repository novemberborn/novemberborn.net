## Skills & Background

I've been working with the web professionally for over ten years. Initially a
front-end engineer I'm now interested in backend systems, JavaScript tooling and
product development. [Learn more about my skills and

## Projects

I maintain several [smallish Node.js modules](/projects/nodejs) and [Babel
plugins](/projects/babel-plugins). I wrote a [Let's
Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) /
[ACME](https://ietf-wg-acme.github.io/acme/) client named
[`wilee`](/projects/wilee). I'm also building [Buoyant](/projects/buoyant): a
framework for building distributed systems using the [Raft Consensus
Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/).

I'm part of the team behind [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) and a
collaborator on [Istanbul](https://github.com/istanbuljs/), primarily through my
contributions to [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc), the Istanbul CLI.

Back in the ES5 era I wrote a small ecosystem of [functional promise-based
libraries](/projects/legendary).
