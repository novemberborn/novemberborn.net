# Projects

I maintain several [smallish Node.js modules](/projects/nodejs) and [Babel
plugins](/projects/babel-plugins). I'm a collaborator on the
[nyc](https://github.com/bcoe/nyc) code coverage tool. I'm also building
[Buoyant](/projects/buoyant): a framework for building distributed systems using
the [Raft Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/).

Back in the ES5 era I wrote a small ecosystem of [functional promise-based
libraries](/projects/legendary).
